## Tests & Coverage (Codecov)

This repo includes a minimal Jest setup and a GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests and uploads coverage to Codecov on every push.

### Run tests locally

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run tests with coverage:

   ```bash
   npm test
   # or
   npx jest --coverage
   ```

After the run, Jest will generate coverage artifacts under `coverage/` (including `coverage/lcov.info`).

### Enable Codecov upload in GitHub Actions

1. Create/sign in to a Codecov account and add this repository.
2. Get the repository upload token from Codecov.
3. In GitHub, add the token as a repository secret:

   - Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
   - Click **New repository secret**
   - Name: `CODECOV_TOKEN`
